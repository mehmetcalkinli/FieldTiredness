Soil exhaustion is a major challenge in agriculture, affecting crop yield and long-term sustainability. To address this, I developed a C++ algorithm that calculates the tiredness (degradation) of a field over several years based on key agricultural factors such as crop rotation, fertilizer usage, irrigation, and environmental conditions.

My system evaluates soil depletion rates, estimates future exhaustion, and provides recommendations to improve soil health. By analyzing historical data and forecasting trends, this tool helps farmers optimize their practices for better sustainability and productivity.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop analytical algorithms, handle agricultural data, and create practical solutions for real-world problems.
